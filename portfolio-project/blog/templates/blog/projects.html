        <h2>Access Control List Stigonography</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5><p>The project objective is to store the files in the format of access permissions which are there in Linux operating system. The file can be accessed only by using the key which is
          generated by the system so that only legitimate person can have access of it. The technology used for developing this project was Java. Small application was developed through which
          file was being encrypted</p></h5>


        <h2>Authorized Vehicle Access uing IoT</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5> <p>With the help of Internet of Things, we are proposing a system where bike can be accessed with help of finger print scanning. In our system, a button will be replaced by a finger
              print sensor which will be used to authenticate the bike rider. Once the finger is matched with one in database then only the rider can ride that bike. An android application will
              be provided in this system. Whenever a finger is scanned then a notification will be sent to the owner of that bike. If the permission is granted by the owner then only his bike can
              be accessed for respective time decided by user. Owner can also track the current route of the bike. In this case both should have that android application installed in their mobiles.
              Now if any layman tries to scan his finger then bike doesnâ€™t response to it. If owner want to share his/her bike with another person he/she can approve though that app he/she can
              assign access of the bike to another person on time basis and after sharing the bike if owner want to track location he/she can able with the help of the GPS (Global Positioning System)
              sensor is placed on bike which can share its location information to the application. The Owner of the bike can also access the bikes status information like air pressure.</p> </h5>
